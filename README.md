## Design Philosophy

- **Visual Style**: Clean, modern design with rounded corners and friendly shapes
- **Color Palette**: Earth tones (browns, greens) with pops of bright, cheerful colors like yellow or orange
- **Tone**: Witty but straightforward - acknowledge the silly name while emphasizing the practical solution
- **Animations**: Smooth animations showing the robot in action
- **White Space**: Plenty of white space to feel fresh and sanitary
